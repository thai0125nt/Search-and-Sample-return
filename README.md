# To run this project, you need install unity and initialize a simulator environment
#Download and Launch the Simulator

#The first step of the project is to download the simulator and familiarize yourself with how it works.
#Use the links below to get the simulator version that's appropriate for your operating system. 

#MacOS: https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-robotics/Rover+Unity+Sims/Mac_Roversim.zip
#window: https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-robotics/Rover+Unity+Sims/Windows_Roversim.zip
#Linux: https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-robotics/Rover+Unity+Sims/Windows_Roversim.zip

#When you launch (double click on) the simulator you will have the option to set the resolution and graphics quality (choose lower resolution / quality for faster rendering).
#Be sure to check the box next to "Windowed" so the simulator doesn't take up the full screen.
#Click on the "input" tab to change the keyboard input definitions (this may be necessary if you are on a non-U.S. keyboard).
#The next time you launch these settings will be restored. Click "Play" to launch the simulator!

#Choose Autonomous Mode and call drive_rover.py from CMD in window or terminal in Ubuntu.
